notes:
  - "We welcome both long (up to 8 pages) and short (up to 4 pages) submissions in ACL format (excluding references and appendices)."
  - "At submission time, authors must indicate whether the paper is intended for archival (proceedings) or non-archival presentation."
  - "ARR-reviewed papers can be submitted via the commitment form if they have not been accepted/published elsewhere."
  - "ACL Findings / main-conference papers may request cross-presentation via the non-archival track (subject to capacity)."
  - "We welcome a broad spectrum of contributions: position papers, datasets/benchmarks, systems reports, ablations, and negative results (when well-supported)."
  - "If you rely on non-public resources (e.g., proprietary data), ensure results are responsibly summarized and compliant with ACL policies."
