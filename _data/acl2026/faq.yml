items:
  - q: "What’s the difference between archival and non-archival submissions?"
    a: "Archival papers are published in the ACL Anthology. Non-archival papers are for presentation/discussion only and are not published in the ACL Anthology."
  - q: "How do I choose between archival and non-archival?"
    a: "Choose archival if you want the paper published in the ACL Anthology and it is not committed to another venue. Choose non-archival if the work is already published, is an ACL Findings/main-conference cross-presentation request (subject to capacity), or if you plan to submit the work to a future venue."
  - q: "Are submissions double-blind?"
    a: "Please follow ARR/ACL workshop submission requirements. If anonymization is required for your track, do not include author names/affiliations in the submitted PDF."
  - q: "Can I submit an ARR-reviewed paper?"
    a: "Yes. If your paper has ARR reviews and is not accepted/published elsewhere, you can submit via the SURGeLLM ARR commitment form on OpenReview."
  - q: "Can I cross-present an ACL Findings or main-conference paper?"
    a: "Yes, via the non-archival track (subject to workshop capacity)."
  - q: "Do you accept short papers?"
    a: "Yes. We welcome both short (up to 4 pages) and long (up to 8 pages) submissions in ACL format (excluding references and appendices)."
  - q: "Do you welcome negative results or lessons learned?"
    a: "Yes. We welcome careful ablations, negative results, and reproducibility studies when well-supported and clearly communicated."
  - q: "Can I submit benchmarks, datasets, or systems papers?"
    a: "Yes. We welcome benchmarks, datasets, tooling, and systems reports, including work that studies evaluation, contamination, scalability, and real-world deployment constraints."
  - q: "Will there be remote attendance options?"
    a: "We aim to support hybrid/virtual participation (live-stream and recordings), subject to ACL policies and technical constraints."
  - q: "Will there be awards or travel/registration support?"
    a: "We are exploring sponsorships to support community awards and diversity & inclusion efforts (e.g., registration subsidies). Details will be announced if available."
  - q: "How can I contact the organizers?"
    a: "Email surgellm@googlegroups.com."
