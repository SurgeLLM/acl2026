## Registration

Workshop attendance is part of ACL 2026 registration. Please follow ACL registration instructions once they are published.

## Hybrid / virtual participation

We aim to support remote attendees via live-streamed and recorded sessions, subject to ACL policies and technical constraints.

If hybrid participation is supported by ACL, we plan to:

- Live-stream and record sessions for remote access.
- Provide clear instructions for remote presenters and attendees.
- Support remote poster presentation where feasible (e.g., poster printing/setup and Q&A logistics).
