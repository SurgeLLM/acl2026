      SURGeLLM brings together researchers and practitioners across NLP, information retrieval, data management, and visualization to make structured artifacts
      (tables, charts, maps, flowcharts, and diagrams) first-class citizens in modern LLM systems — across understanding, retrieval, generation, and evaluation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Structured understanding</strong>: robust reasoning and attribution over tables, databases, and other structured artifacts.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured retrieval</strong>: structure-aware retrieval for tables/cells, charts, maps, workflows, and code.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured generation</strong>: text → SQL/table/chart/code with faithfulness, controllability, and reliable evaluation.</li>
      <li><strong>LLMs + structured data</strong>: data-centric methods, benchmarks, and real-world deployments with governance.</li>
      <li><strong>Community</strong>: invited talks, posters, a panel, and a student mentoring lunch session.</li>
    </ul>
